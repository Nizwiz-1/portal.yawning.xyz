## Outline

The Yawning Portal is a popular tavern in the city of Waterdeep, where adventurers from all over the Forgotten Realms and beyond gather to drink, trade stories of epic heroism, and gather intel on various goings on that may lead an adventurer to riches beyond their wildest imaginations.

This is not The Yawning Portal.

portal.yawning.xyz is a social media website created by one man in his mother's basement for use by his D&D playgroup. All are welcome here, but please be respectful of others, and don't make a mess on the carpet.

## My Projects, My Resume and My Philosophy

This project is a learning tool for me, a way to pass the time, as well as a way to demonstrate my knowldege of NodeJS, ReactJS, MySQL and everything that goes with them. As such, this project is included on my [web development resume](https://krgamestudios.com/resume/Webdev.pdf). Since this is a demonstration of my skills, you'll have to forgive me if I go slow and try to get things to conform to my own beliefs and philosophies.

"Make it work, then make it fast" This is something that I strive for. Maintaining stability is why some branches may be delayed in becoming part of the master branch. It is also why I'll drop everything to fix a bug before I implement new features. Thus, 3rd party libraries like formidable may be present, but not yet used.
